# GRUWITHAUGMENTATION

1)Proposed Method
We apply modified version of GRU with various Data Augmentation Methods. 
At first, Our modification entails the integration of information from both the current $t$ and preceding $t-1$ time steps. By updating the GRU Cell design to include information from two sequential time points, we aim to improve the learning of time sequences.
